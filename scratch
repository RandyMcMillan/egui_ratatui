Hello everyone ! I present to you my newest crate - ratatui_egui_wasm .
It allows you to create Terminal User Interfaces with ratatui inside of EGUI , and is wasm compatible
Previously I had made bevy_ratatui , but it was not very good , now I created a new backend for ratatui which uses egui.
Thus this new crate supercedes my old bevy_ratatui crate , since now you can use bevy_egui + ratatui_egui_wasm to get a much better experience
Plus performance is like 100x times better :D
