Hello everyone ! I present to you my newest crate - egui_ratatui .
It allows you to create Terminal User Interfaces with ratatui inside of EGUI , and is wasm compatible
Previously I had made bevy_ratatui , but it was not very good , now I created a new backend for ratatui which uses egui.
Thus this new crate supercedes my old bevy_ratatui crate , since now you can use bevy_egui + egui_ratatui to get a much better experience
Plus performance is like 100x times better :D

Hello everyone ! I present to you version 1.1.1 of my crate - egui_ratatui.

With this release I have added a good bevy example into the repo, check out the bevy_example folder

It allows you to create Terminal User Interfaces with ratatui inside of EGUI , and is wasm compatible
Internally the crate has fixed a few minor bugs that showed up during the process of porting all examples
As well as slight performance improvements
Good news: there have been ZERO changes to the user facing api, the api is extremely stable and production ready (tm)
I have added a default features flag, which you can use to avoid importing eframe and web time into your project
